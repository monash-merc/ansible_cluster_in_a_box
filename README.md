This repo has been forked. The current development occurs at https://gitlab.erc.monash.edu.au/hpc-team/HPCasCode/ . We're leaving this here as an artifact



ansible_cluster_in_a_box
========================

The aim of this repo is to provide a set or ansible roles that can be used to deploy a cluster
We are working from 
https://docs.google.com/a/monash.edu/spreadsheets/d/1IZNE7vMid_SHYxImGVtQcNUiUIrs_Nu1xqolyblr0AE/edit#gid=0
as our architecture document.

We aim to make these roles as generic as possible. You should be able to start from an inventory file, an ssh key and a git clone of this and end up with a working cluster. In the longer term we might branch to include utilities to make an inventory file using NeCTAR credentials.

If you need a password use get_or_make_password.py (delegated to the passwword server/localhost) to generate a random one that can be shared between nodes
Here is an example task (taken from setting up karaage):
- name: mysql db
  mysql_db: name=karaage login_user=root login_password={{ sqlrootPasswd.stdout }}

- name: karaage sql password
  shell: ~/get_or_make_passwd.py karaageSQL
  delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
  register: karaageSqlPassword

- name: mysql user
  mysql_user: name='karaage' password={{ item }} priv=karaage.*:ALL state=present login_user=root login_password={{ sqlrootPasswd.stdout }}
  with_items: karaageSqlPassword.stdout


We aim to make these roles run on all common linux platforms (both RedHat and Debian derived) but at the very least they should work on a CentOS 6 install.
